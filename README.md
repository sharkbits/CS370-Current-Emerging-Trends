# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

In this project, I completed the implementation of a deep Q-learning algorithm for the Treasure Hunt Game notebook. The provided code included the environment setup, neural network architecture, and helper classes for managing the maze and experience replay. My main task was to build the core training loop in the `qtrain()` function, where I implemented the exploration-exploitation logic, updated Q-values through experience replay, and managed the agent’s learning process. By combining these components, I created a self-learning agent capable of navigating the maze and finding the treasure efficiently.

# Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science: What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists analyze complex problems and design computational solutions that improve efficiency, security, and automation in the real world. This project demonstrated how reinforcement learning embodies key computer science principles—using algorithms, data structures, and neural networks to simulate learning and decision-making. The broader field emphasizes innovation with responsibility, as computer scientists shape technologies that influence communication, business, and daily life. By building systems that learn from experience, I saw firsthand how theory and practice converge to create intelligent, adaptive software.

# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

I approach problems systematically by first defining the challenge, modeling it in computational terms, and then designing and testing algorithmic solutions. In the Treasure Hunt Game, this meant representing the maze as an environment, identifying states and actions, and designing a deep Q-learning strategy to train the agent through exploration and feedback. After implementation, I refined the model through evaluation and tuning. This structured, iterative approach—rooted in logic and experimentation—illustrates how computer scientists tackle problems both creatively and analytically.

# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

My ethical responsibilities center on protecting user privacy, ensuring fairness, and maintaining the integrity of both data and systems. For end users, this means creating reliable, transparent, and accessible software that safeguards their information. For the organization, it involves following security protocols, upholding compliance standards, and promoting ethical decision-making in design and deployment. By prioritizing accountability and transparency, I help ensure that the technology I develop benefits society while maintaining trust and professional integrity.
